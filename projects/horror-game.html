<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This project is a first-person horror game developed in Unreal Engine 5 with a strong
focus on atmosphere, real-time lighting, and performance-conscious systems.
My primary contributions centered on technical art workflows, including materials,
procedural systems, lighting, optimization, and AI integration.
</p>

<h2>Gameplay / Visual Demo</h2>

<h2>Technical Focus Areas</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Custom material and shader workflows</li>
    <li>Real-time lighting and atmosphere control</li>
    <li>Procedural environment generation (PCG)</li>
    <li>AI state logic and animation integration</li>
    <li>Performance optimization and debugging</li>
</ul>

<h2>Materials & Shaders</h2>
<p>
I developed and iterated on custom materials to support the horror atmosphere while
remaining performance-conscious. This included controlling roughness, emissive
values, and texture usage to ensure consistent lighting behavior across environments.
Material instances were used extensively to allow rapid iteration without recompiling
base shaders.

<h2>Lighting & Atmosphere</h2>
<p>
Lighting played a critical role in defining the tone of the experience. I worked with
dynamic lighting, exposure control, and fog to guide player attention and create tension.
Care was taken to balance visual quality with real-time performance constraints.
</p>

<h2>Procedural Systems & PCG</h2>
<p>
Procedural Content Generation was used to populate environments efficiently.
I tuned density, culling, and transform logic to maintain visual consistency while
avoiding unnecessary performance costs. Iteration speed and scalability were key
considerations in these systems.
</p>

<h2>AI, Animation & State Logic</h2>
<p>
NPC behavior was implemented using Unreal’s State Tree system, integrating movement,
animation states, and gameplay triggers. I focused on ensuring clean transitions
between states and reliable communication between animation, AI, and gameplay logic.
</p>

<h2>Optimization & Problem Solving</h2>
<p>
Throughout development, I identified and addressed performance bottlenecks related
to lighting, materials, and procedural systems. Debugging tools and profiling were
used to guide decisions such as simplifying materials, adjusting PCG density, and
refining update logic.
</p>

<h2>What I Learned / What I’d Do Next</h2>
<p>
This project reinforced the importance of technical art as a balance between visual
quality and performance. Given more time, I would further expand tooling for faster
iteration and explore additional shader-driven effects to enhance atmosphere without
significant runtime cost.
