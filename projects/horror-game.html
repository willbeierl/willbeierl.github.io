<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This project is a first-person horror game developed in Unreal Engine 5 with a strong
focus on atmosphere, real-time lighting, and performance-conscious systems.
My primary contributions centered on technical art workflows, including materials,
procedural systems, lighting, optimization, and AI integration.

<h2>Technical Focus Areas</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Custom material and shader workflows</li>
    <li>Real-time lighting and atmosphere control</li>
    <li>Procedural environment generation (PCG)</li>
    <li>AI state logic and animation integration</li>
    <li>Performance optimization and debugging</li>
</ul>

<h2>Materials & Shaders</h2>
<p>
I developed and modified on custom materials to support the horror atmosphere while
remaining performance conscious. This included controlling roughness, emissive
values, and texture usage to ensure consistent lighting behavior across environments. 
I made use of material instances extensively which allowed quick material tweaks without recompiling
the entire base shaders.

<h2>Lighting & Atmosphere</h2>
<p>
Lighting played a critical role in defining the tone of the experience. I worked with
dynamic lighting, exposure control, and custom built volumetric fog to guide player attention and create tension.

<h2>Procedural Systems & PCG</h2>
<p>
Procedural Content Generation (PCG) was used to create the environment efficiently.
I tuned density, culling, and transform logic to stylize the world while
avoiding unnecessary performance costs. I made use of UE5.7's new nanite voxelize fooliage
feature to keep the overdraw of the scene manageable to optimize performance.
</p>

<h2>AI, Animation & State Logic</h2>
<p>
NPC behavior was implemented using Unreal’s State Tree system, integrating movement,
animation states, and gameplay triggers. I focused on ensuring clean transitions
between states and reliable communication between animation, AI, and gameplay logic.
</p>

<h2>Optimization & Problem Solving</h2>
<p>
Throughout development, I identified and addressed performance bottlenecks related
to lighting, materials, and procedural systems. Debugging tools were
used to guide decisions such as simplifying materials, adjusting PCG density, and
refining update logic.
</p>

<h2>What I Learned / What I’d Do Next</h2>
<p>
This project reinforced the importance of technical art as a balance between visual
quality and performance. Given more time, I would further expand tooling for faster
iteration and explore additional shader-driven effects to enhance atmosphere without
significant runtime cost.
